> This guidelines sheet is forked from [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/8d9c7cee56d6c2eac81dc156ce27be6716d97e68/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Gitote is not perfect, and it has bugs or incomplete features in rare cases. You're welcome to tell us, or to contribute some code. This document describes details about how can you contribute to Gitote project.

## Contribution guidelines

Depends on the situation, you will:

- Find a bug and create an issue
- Need more functionality and make a feature request
- Want to contribute code and open a pull request
- Run into issue and need help

### Bug Report

If you find something you consider a bug, please create an issue on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitote/gitote/issues). To avoid wasting time and reduce back-and-forth communication with team members, please be respect to **Issue Template**.

### Feature Request

There is no standard form of making a feature request. Just try to describe the feature as clearly as possible, because team members may not have experience with the functionality you're talking about.

### Merge Request

Please read detailed information on [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/gitote/gitote/wiki/Contributing-Code).
